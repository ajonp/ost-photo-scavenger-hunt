Hey OST!
We’re having a photo scavenger hunt next week! You might be wondering what that means… good question! Thanks for asking! It means that we’re going to have a competition between self chosen teams to see who can complete the most photo prompts on our photo scavenger hunt list. 
Once you have a team of 3–5 people, nominate a captain (probably the most Type A person in the group :wink:) and set up a Slack group message for strategizing! Team Captains will be in charge of posting their team's accumulative score at the beginning of every day (Like we said, Type A person!) Also, come up with a dope team name!
Team Captains! Once you have a team together, announce your team and what your team name is on the #photo-scavenger-hunt Slack channel. 
We’ve ranked the photo prompts into a point system, depending on the difficulty. We’ve also broken some prompts out by location so we recommend you get a geographically diverse team! 
Once you’ve completed a photo prompt share it to the #photo-scavenger-hunt Slack channel so it can be added to your team’s points! You’ll have from August 3–6 to get as many photos as possible, final scores and the winners will be announced Friday, August 7! The top three teams with the highest points at the end of week will win some sweet prizes!
We just have a few rules to follow while scavenging for photos. Rule #1, don’t talk about the photo scav… just kidding! Here are the actual rules:
If you’re going outside to complete your prompt, stay socially distant and wear a mask
Those that can’t go outside should be given the prompts that can be done at home
Teams can only post each prompt once
When you’re posting to the #photo-scavenger-hunt Slack channel, please add your team name and the prompt that’s in your photo
Here’s the photo list, now get your teams together and start divvying up the prompts!
